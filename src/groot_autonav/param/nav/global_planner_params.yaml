  use_quadratic: true                           # Use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation, default true
  # Set to true, the quadratic function approximation function, otherwise use a more simple method of calculation, which saves hardware computing resources. The default value is true

  # If set to true, the grid plan a route along the border, biased in favor of a straight line across the grid, otherwise, the gradient descent algorithm, the default path smoother points:. False (gradient descent)
